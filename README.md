## LDP for Data Clustering

### Abstract
Data clustering is a popular method in unsupervised learning to detect patterns in unlabeled data from all types of domains. Especially when dealing with sensitive data, for example, health data, careful consideration has to be made when aggregating and utilizing it. Many individuals do not want their private health data to become public or deducible from clustering outcomes. We apply Local Differential Privacy to allow individuals to locally randomize their data before sharing it with a data aggregator. Based on the randomized data points, we are able to generate a model that labels 75\% of data points the same as a data set trained on the original data does.
